Service Booking Application — Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Project Name: Service Booking Application
Document Type: Product Requirements Document
Version: 1.0
Status: Approved for Development

1. Product Overview
1.1 Introduction
The Service Booking Application is a full-stack web application designed for clinics or service centers to manage appointments digitally.

The application allows customers to register, log in, browse available services, select appointment slots, create bookings, reschedule appointments, cancel appointments, and view their booking history.

Administrators can manage services, providers, availability slots, and customer bookings through an administrative dashboard.

The goal is to replace manual appointment scheduling with a centralized, easy-to-use, and reliable digital booking system.

1.2 Problem Statement
Many clinics and service centers manage appointments through phone calls, spreadsheets, or manual registers.

This can create problems such as:

Customers cannot easily see available appointment times.
Staff must manually manage appointment schedules.
Multiple customers may request the same appointment.
Rescheduling and cancellation can be difficult to track.
Administrators may not have a clear overview of daily appointments.
Booking history may be difficult to maintain.
Customers may need to contact staff for basic appointment information.
The application addresses these problems through online appointment booking and centralized administration.

1.3 Product Goals
The application must:

Allow customers to create accounts and securely log in.
Display available services.
Display valid appointment slots.
Allow customers to book appointments.
Allow customers to reschedule eligible appointments.
Allow customers to cancel eligible appointments.
Maintain customer booking history.
Allow administrators to manage services and availability.
Allow administrators to manage bookings.
Prevent invalid and duplicate bookings.
Provide a responsive and accessible user interface.
Protect customer information through authentication and authorization.
2. Target Users
The application has two primary user roles.

2.1 Customer

Activate or deactivate services.
Manage providers where applicable.
Create availability slots.
Update availability.
View all customer bookings.
Filter and search bookings.
Confirm eligible bookings.
Cancel eligible bookings.
Mark eligible appointments as completed.
Example
An administrator wants to make appointments available for a doctor.

They should be able to:

Open the admin dashboard.
Navigate to Availability.
Select the provider.
Select the service.
Choose the date and time.
Set the slot capacity.

6. Booking Business Rules
The following rules are essential to the application's correctness.

6.1 Capacity Rule
An availability slot must never exceed its configured capacity.

Example:

A slot has a capacity of 5.

First booking: allowed.
Second booking: allowed.
Third booking: allowed.
Fourth booking: allowed.
Fifth booking: allowed.
Sixth booking: rejected.
The backend must enforce this rule, even if multiple customers submit requests simultaneously.

6.2 Double-Booking Prevention
The application must prevent invalid duplicate reservations.

A frontend availability check is not sufficient.

Use database transactions and appropriate concurrency control, such as row-level locking, when reserving capacity.

6.3 Booking Ownership
A customer must only view, reschedule, or cancel their own bookings.

Administrators may access bookings according to their permissions.

6.4 Cancellation Rule
Only eligible bookings may be cancelled.

The exact cancellation deadline or policy must be configurable or clearly documented before release.

Do not invent a cancellation window in application code without an approved business rule.

6.5 Rescheduling Rule
Only eligible bookings may be rescheduled.

The new slot must have sufficient capacity and satisfy all scheduling rules.

6.6 Historical Records
Cancelling a booking must not delete it.

Historical booking records must remain available.

6.7 Date and Time Rule
Store timestamps in UTC.

Convert to the user's local timezone for display.

Do not compare date-time strings without correct timezone handling.

6.8 Status Transition Rule
Only approved transitions are allowed.

Examples:

Pending → Confirmed.
Pending → Cancelled.
Confirmed → Cancelled.
Confirmed → Completed.
Other transitions must be rejected unless explicitly approved as a business requirement.

7. User Interface Requirements
7.1 Design Direction
Use the GoCliniq website as a visual reference:

https://gocliniq.in/

The application should have a professional healthcare SaaS appearance.

Do not copy its logo, branding, proprietary assets, or source code.

Follow ai-assistant/design.md for the detailed design system.

7.2 General Design Requirements
The interface must:

Be clean and professional.
Use a consistent color palette.
Have clear navigation.
Use readable typography.

Follow accessibility best practices.
7.3 Required Customer Pages
Public home page.
Login page.
Registration page.

Booking flow.
Customer dashboard.
My bookings page.
Booking details page.
Profile page.
7.4 Required Admin Pages
Admin dashboard.
Services management page.
Providers management page.
Availability management page.
Booking management page.
Provider management may be simplified if the final clinic workflow does not require customer provider selection, but the decision must be documented.

7.5 Responsive Requirements

Main content area.
Tables and calendar views.
Summary cards.
Tablet:

Collapsible navigation.
Responsive grids.

Use consistent JSON responses.

Successful response example:

json

17. Final Product Definition
The Service Booking Application is a responsive, secure, full-stack appointment-management platform.

It connects customers and administrators through a centralized booking workflow.

Customers can discover services, find available appointment slots, create bookings, manage appointments, and view their history.

Administrators can manage services, providers, availability, and bookings.

The system uses React, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, JWT authentication, and role-based authorization.

The primary success measure is a reliable end-to-end booking workflow where customers can manage appointments and administrators can manage schedules without invalid or duplicate reservations.
