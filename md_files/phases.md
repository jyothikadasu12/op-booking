Service Booking Application — Development Phases
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the step-by-step development roadmap for the Service Booking Application.

The project must be developed phase by phase. Each phase introduces specific concepts, implementation tasks, expected deliverables, and completion criteria.

The AI coding assistant must follow this roadmap instead of generating the entire application at once.

Project Objective
Build a responsive appointment-booking application for a clinic or service center.

Customers should be able to:

Register and log in.
Browse available services.
View providers and available appointment slots.
Book appointments.
Reschedule appointments.
Cancel appointments.
View their booking history.
Manage their profile.
Administrators should be able to:

Log in using an administrator account.
Manage services.
Manage providers.
Create and manage availability slots.
View and manage all bookings.
Update booking statuses.
Monitor appointment activity.
2. Technology Stack
The following technologies must be used throughout the project.

Area	Technology
Frontend	React with JavaScript
Build tool	Vite
Styling	Tailwind CSS
Routing	React Router
HTTP requests	Axios
Frontend state	React Context API and hooks
Backend	Python and FastAPI
Database	PostgreSQL

Do not replace PostgreSQL with SQLite.
Use SQLAlchemy for database operations.
Use Alembic for database schema migrations.
Do not hardcode database passwords, JWT secrets, or other credentials.
Keep the frontend and backend independently organized.
3. Development Workflow
Follow this workflow for every phase:

Understand the phase requirements.
Identify the concepts that need to be learned.

Implement the functionality step by step.
Explain important code and architectural decisions.
Run the application and test the implementation.
Fix errors before proceeding.
Update the README or relevant documentation when necessary.
Confirm that the phase completion criteria are satisfied.
The AI assistant must not skip unfinished tasks or silently move to the next phase.

15. Rules for the AI Coding Assistant
The AI coding assistant must follow these rules throughout development.

Follow the phases in the exact order defined in this document.
Do not implement multiple major phases at once.
Do not skip concepts or requirements.
Use JavaScript only in the React frontend.
Use FastAPI and Python for the backend.
Use PostgreSQL as the primary database.
Use pgAdmin 4 for local database administration.
Use SQLAlchemy for database access.
Use Alembic for schema migrations.
Follow the architecture in architecture.md.
Follow the UI guidelines in design.md.
Keep the code modular and reusable.
Follow the existing folder structure unless a justified change is needed.
Never overwrite existing working code without first understanding its purpose.
Do not generate fake API responses as a substitute for real backend integration in completed features.
Do not hardcode passwords, JWT secrets, or API credentials.
Implement backend validation even when frontend validation exists.
Enforce authentication and authorization on the backend.
Protect customer booking data through ownership checks.
Prevent double booking through database-safe transaction handling.
Explain important code decisions in beginner-friendly language.
Provide exact filenames and folder paths when sharing code.
Provide complete code for each requested file rather than disconnected fragments.
Explain how to run and test each implemented feature.
Fix errors in the current phase before moving forward.
Update relevant documentation when implementation decisions change.
Do not claim a feature is complete without testing it.
16. Definition of Project Completion
The Service Booking Application can be considered complete when:

Customers can register and log in.
Customers can browse active services.
Customers can view valid availability.
Customers can create appointments.
Customers can view their own booking history.
Customers can reschedule eligible appointments.
Customers can cancel eligible appointments.
Administrators can manage services.
Administrators can manage providers where applicable.
Administrators can manage availability.
Administrators can manage bookings.
JWT authentication and role-based authorization work.
PostgreSQL stores application data correctly.
Booking capacity and concurrency rules are enforced.
Frontend and backend tests pass.
The application is responsive.
Docker configuration is available.
Setup and usage documentation is complete.
Final development principle: Build a working, tested, secure feature at a time. Correctness and understanding are more important than rushing through all ten phases.
